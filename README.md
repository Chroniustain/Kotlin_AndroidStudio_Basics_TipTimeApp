Project: Tip Time App
==================================

The 4th project of Kotlin on Android Studio Basics course.

Introduction
------------

In this project we will create an interactive application for people to calculate potential tips to services that they were happy with.

1) We will learn about creating and modifying the layout editor through xml files.
2) We will implement view binding feature for easier use/edit of the UI elements through code.
3) We will add code to our project in order to calculate a tip based on initial cost, a percentage of our choice and a round up option.
4) We will present this tip result to user's prefered currency.
